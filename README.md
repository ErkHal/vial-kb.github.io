## What is Vial?

Vial is an open-source cross-platform (Windows, Linux and Mac) GUI and a QMK fork for configuring your keyboard in real time, similar to VIA.

If you're already familiar with VIA, the major difference is that Vial is a completely open project, with sources for all components publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vial-kb).

Another big goal for the project was to reduce reliance on third parties when developing a new keyboard. With Vial, you do not have to submit your keyboard as a pull-request for QMK and/or VIA (which usually takes several months to be accepted) before it can be used in the GUI; rather, the keymap JSON defition is stored within the keyboard firmware and is retrieved at runtime.

Vial implements several additional quality-of-life features that are documented in the topics linked below.
